# Product-Manager--MERN-
Developed a Product Manager Panel using the MERN stack. This project enables users to manage products, create, track, and prioritize tasks. Key features include CRUD operations and a user-friendly interface. All front-end design components were kept modular and reusable, making code maintenance and updates more efficient.
